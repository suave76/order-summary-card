### What I learned

Helped me learn the basic styling and elements used for a basic card element. Learnt about hover states.
Also this project made me realise how help is semantic html and how to make a library of css classes (utility.css) and how easy it makes to style a page. 


### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is one of my goto website which helps me understand almost all concepts of web dev. I'd recommend it to anyone.
- [CSS-tricks](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Best place to learn about flex.
